        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, my name is Elmenthy Teng and I am currently a student at University of California, Riverside, majoring in economics and administrive studies. I do not have much work experience currently, but I used to volunteer on a weekly basis. From my experience, I learned how to work with customers to ensure both the seller and purchaser are statisfied. Not only have I had volunteer experience, but I also had 
                              leadership experience in the form of a track captain in highschool. During my time as a track captain in highschool,
                              I leanred how to manage multiple athletes ranging from freshmen to seniors. Whenever an athlete needed assistance I provided
                              The help that they needed, such as proving critism to improve their performance and creating team bonding events. Through my leadership, 
                              my team was able to obtain a perfect record of seven and zero against the schools in our league. Despite my little experience with leadership and management, I strive to gain more of that experiene. 
                              I hunger for improvement and to be the best possible person that I can be, not only for myself but for others as well. <br><br>

        Personally, I am a relaxed person and I do not mind when unfortunes happen.
        This is because I know that I can recover from what occurs and I can work 
        towards a better result. I believe this is the result of having a growing mindset,
        thus when something negative occurs I believe I can bounce back from it more motivated than ever.
        However, I believe that this can result in flaws. For example, I would over commit to a projects
        and thus I put too much resources into a project. However this can have pros as well. For example, by overcommiting to a project
        I can produce excellent results. Not only am I determined to create great results for 
        a project.<br><br>

        As a person and outside of the workplace I am an enjoyable person that does not
        aim to put people down. I love to help people reach their peak performance mentally. 
        If a person is down, then my goal is to cheer them up and provide them with needed
        advice. It personally makes me feel like I accomplished something by helping another.
        I aim to be helpful to the people I care for and strangers in need. Yet, I believe that 
        this trait can be my downfall because people would aim to abuse my helpfulness and abuse it.
        Although it bothers me that people abuse my kindness, I try to look overlook the negatives and 
        purely look at the positives.  As for another trait of mine, I am also a calm person. Whenever a situation
        arises that envokes panic with in people, I do not panic with them but I aim to calm down others 
        with me. By calming others with me, we can focus on the situation at a whole without the interference
        of being paniced.
